# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
*I think these are a lot easier in Excel. However, at this level, where there isn't an extreme level of nesting, I think I'm coping with the complexity*

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
*I think based on the above, I feel confident that I can read and understand/use logical operators*

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
*I think at this level they're not overly complex. However, I know once you start nesting them, they can get pretty complex*

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
*The entire lesson took much longer than I expected. Maybe even 2x as much. Some of things that took longer than expected was just creating repositories and committing changes at every stage. I also did some note taking in addition to reading my prior notes. I was also not as focused on time because I know this is complex material that becomes the foundation for later layers*

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*I definitely need to practice if_statements and decision making scenarios. Specifically where you're soliciting user inputs, it really gets closer to what we might experience in Mod 1*

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*As mentioned, I think I need to practice these concepts a lot more and I think I'm going to try and do that during the break*
